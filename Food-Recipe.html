    <h1>Onugbu Soup (Bitter-Leaf Soup)</h1>
    <img src="Bitter leaf.jpg" alt="">
    <div>
    <p class="write">Bitter leaf (Onugbu in Igbo) is obtained from the leaves of a diminutive evergreen shrub called Vernonia, which grows throughout Nigeria.<br> The bitter leaf is a medicinal leaf and that is why it is popular in Nigeria especially in the southern part of Nigeria.
 <br>The bitter leaf soup (or ‘Ofe Onugbu’) is regarded as having its origin as per the edibility of the leaves in a soup traced to Nnewi in Anambra state of Nigeria. <br>There is no historic assertion for its origin however but the Igbos believe,<br> Nnewi people introduced the delicious soup to other Igbos from where the delicious consumption spread to other parts of Nigeria.</p>
<p class="up"> The Nnewi people usually eat the soup with pounded yam, or, especially with akpu or loi loi (made from cassava ).<br> The soup is now widely eaten in Nigeria</p>

    <h2>Preparations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start by boiling your meats, start with the tougher meats like Cow leg and Shaki first. When they’re slightly tender, add beef or other softer meats. When all the meats are tender, add the Stockfish, leave to cook till soft….</li>
        <li>While the meats are boiling, boil the Cocoyam with the skin on. Do not add salt, boil till tender, this should take roughly 20 minutes on medium heat…</li>
        <li>When they are soft, gently peel the skin off and pound till smooth in a mortar. Alternatively, chop them into small chunks and purée in your electric blender or food processor till smooth, then set aside…</li>
        <li>Wash the Bitter leaves with hot water to get rid of as much bitterness as you can. There should be almost no hint of bitterness left in the leaves after washing</li>
        <li>When the Meats and Fish are all soft, add Crayfish, smoked Prawns, then add the ground or blended pepper. Stir and combine…</li>
        <li>Add Palm oil, leave to thoroughly combine for 3-4 minutes…</li>
        <li>Now, turn the heat done to low, add the blended Cocoyam into the stock in small dollops, be careful not to add too much. The consistency should be semi fluid….</li>
        <li>The Cocoyam will dissolve; thickening the soul, leave to dissolve and combine for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Then add the Ogiri, stir and combine. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary</li>
        <li>Then add the washed Bitter Leaves, leave to cook for 2-3 minutes. Do not over cook your vegetables</li>
        <li>And it’s done... Serve with your preferred swallow </li>
    </ul>
